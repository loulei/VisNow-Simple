== IMPORTANT NOTE on maximum force (NOMINAL_MAX_FORCE and NOMINAL_MAX_CONTINUOUS_FORCE) ==

There are two parameters describing haptic max force:
NOMINAL_MAX_FORCE and NOMINAL_MAX_CONTINUOUS_FORCE

While NOMINAL_MAX_FORCE is quite big (>30N), NOMINAL_MAX_CONTINUOUS_FORCE is slightly above 6.28N. 
In software limitations for haptic device I hardcoded NOMINAL_MAX_FORCE, not NOMINAL_MAX_CONTINUOUS_FORCE. Therefore it must be noted 
that Phantom device *** must be use with care *** when forces exceed NOMINAL_MAX_CONTINUOUS_FORCE.




      --------------  PROBLEMS  ------------


	  
====== Forces in DampingField and VectorField are generated even when being outside of the haptic outline ======

This happens when the regular field is not a rectangle and seems to be a limitation of Interpolator. Such field must be converted by 'interpolate to mesh' module before linking it to the blue port of HapticViewer3D. To the red port any view can be attached (even not linked to the simulated field).



====== VectorFieldForce and DampingFieldForce need much memory ======

Yes, that's true - it's because each VectorFieldForce or DampingFieldForce object stores locally a copy of float values array of the generated field. This could be fixed by creating RegularFieldInterpolator.getInterpolatedData() functions that will return a float value no matter what type of data the field is. 


====== Cursor on the screen moves in a weird way especially when force (even small) is applied ======

Probably a z axis capstan (a "screw") is loose. Use .050 allen wrench to tighten the capstan (.090 according to Sensable technical support). You must place capstan in a proper position (the shaft is flat on one side and the screw must be over this flat area). You don't need to remove the metal wire - use flat pincers (wÄ…skie szczypce - http://www.gimmik.pl/szczypce-waskie-dlugie-150-mm-77042-p-6477.html) or other tool to hold the shaft while moving the whole black part with motor. Then capstan rotates, while shaft - doesn't.
See images and emails in PDF in folder "broken haptic - loose capstan".

If the problem repeats on regular basis, setting software force ramping should be seriously considered.


======= No forces are generated, although force bar and value shows a non-zero value of the force ======

Reason 1. Force is non-zero, but too small to be perceived. If value of the overall force is less than 1N (one), probably that's this case.

Reason 2. Motors are disabled. Switch on motors on the back of the Phantom's base.

Reason 3. Motors are warm. 
To check it, do as follows:
 1) Close VisNow or at least detach Phantom from HapticViewer3D (button should display "NOT USED").
 2) Run Phantom Test application.
 3) Go to the "Select" tab.
 4) Look at the pink Errors text box on the bottom of the screen. 
 5) It there is still no error message, switch to Box Test and check whether forces are generated. Note that this test is buggy - sometimes there are no forces without a reason or only some forces are generated :/

Non of above? Check errors and Box Test in Phantom Test application as in Reason 3.


======= Haptic pointer reacts with a big delay (0.5 to 1 second) - both moving and pressing  =======

Diagnosis: Windows was hibernated and resumed.

Details:

1. Windows was hibernated with a Visnow program running and haptic device active (with a pointer on a screen). 
	After resuming Windows the delay occurs. 
	Haptic device is connected to the LPT port on motherboard.
	
Workaround: restart Visnow.

2. Windows was hibernated with a Visnow program running and haptic device active (with a pointer on a screen).
	After resuming Windows the delay occurs. 
	Haptic device is connected to the Axxon PCI card with an LPT port.
	
Workaround: restart Windows.

3. Windows was hibernated. After resuming Windows the delay occurs. 
	Haptic device is connected to the Axxon PCI card with an LPT port.
	
Workaround: restart Windows.





====== Phantom moves in a violent way ======

Check update rate.
From OpenHaptics API Reference Manual (function hdSetSchedulerRate): "As a word of caution, decreasing the rate can lead to instabilities and kicking. Increasing the servo loop rate can yield stiffer surfaces and better haptic responsiveness, but leaves
less time for scheduler operations to complete."

Typically update rate should be approx. 1000 Hz. The lower is the value, the more often kicks and buzzing may occur.
