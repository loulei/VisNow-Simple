/**
 * This text field is for testing if user typed input string in proper format; You have to extend this class 
 * and override isValidValue() method; This text field assumes that it ALWAYS contains properly formatted value 
 * (excluding time when user is editing the field).
 * That's why default value is necessary to initialize field.
 * Additionally you can override format() method which reformats input string; By default identity method is used 
 * (no reformatting). 
 * Format is tested after text field has changed (user input:  press ENTER or setText is called).
 * If input is not properly formatted or field lost its focus than input is filled in with last valid value.
 * 
 * 1. This class avoids situation when visible text in input field is different then value of the field (getText) - 
 *    that is the case when there is no action on lost focus.
 * 2. It doesn't format input if format is not provided (like JFormattedTextField does)
 * 3. It tests format only on submit (opposite to DocumentListener)
 * 4. It doesn't force user to input proper value by locking focus (as InputVerifier does)
