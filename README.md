VisNow-Simple
=============

VisNow is a generic visualization framework in Java technology, developed by 
the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling at 
the University of Warsaw.
It is a modular data flow driven platform enabling users to create schemes 
for data visualization, visual analysis, data processing and simple simulations. 
Motivated by 'Read and Watch' idea, VisNow shows the data as soon and fast as 
possible giving further opportunity for processing and more in-depth visualization. 
In a few steps it can create professional images and movies as well as discover 
unknown information hidden in datasets.

VisNow, not trying to be yet another visualization tool, is targeted at overcoming 
the drawbacks of other similar software platforms. It is subject to the following 
keynotes:
 - Clear and legible desktop
 - Network creation support
 - Multifunctional modules
 - Module-Object-Interface connection
